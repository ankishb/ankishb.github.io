<img src="{{ '/assets/images/profile.jpg' | relative_url }}" width="220" height="320" align="right" />I am Ankish Bansal, doing my Graduate from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT, Kanpur</a>, under the supervision of Prof.<a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera/" target="_blank">L.Behera</a>.

<p>My research interset is in the area of machine learning and reinforcement learning, where i am working on meta learning for few shot classification and data sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. In my free time, i read novel or i learn and solve question on Data structure and algorithm on hackerrank and leetcode. Sometime, i also participate in data science challenge on analytics vidhya. I love arts and travelling too.</p>


<p> I'm writting about data scructure, deep learning and algorithms in ML, RL and in general. Send me an email: bansal.ankish1 AT gmail.com, if you have questions or find error in my posts. Thanks :)</p>
