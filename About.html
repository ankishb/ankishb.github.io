<p>My research interset is in the area of machine learning and reinforcement learning, where i am working on meta learning for few shot classification and data sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. In my free time, i learn and solve question on Data structure and algorithm on hackerrank and leetcode. Sometime, i also participate in data science challenge on analytics vidhya.</p>


<p> I'm writting about data scructure, deep learning and algorithms in ML, RL and in general. Send me an email: bansal.ankish1 AT gmail.com, if you have questions or find error in my posts. Thanks :)</p>
