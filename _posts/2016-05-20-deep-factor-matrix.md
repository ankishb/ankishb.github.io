# Deep Matrix Factorization Model:

## Higher Level Idea

Keep two network, one for users having rating for each items, another for items having rating by each users. So we have one big vectors for ecah network, which will find the latent representation for user and item. After that, find the similarity(interaction) between user and item using cosine similarity.

Authr also presented new loss function which is called normalized cross entropy, which is same as binary cross entropy, except **Y** changed by **Y/max(R)**, where **max(R)** is the maximum rating. For example in 5 star rating system, it is 5.




Squred loss finction can not be used well with implicit feedback, because for implicit data, the target value Y ij is a binarized 1 or 0 denoting whether i has interacted with j or not. 
In what follows, a loss function which pays special attention to the binary property of implicit data was proposed by [He et al., 2017] as follows.	cross-entropy loss function



The Warden

This is about cleaning the back area in our hall. As you know that each year, some of old tree fall down and it is necessory to remove those trees from hall. This has been followed in each hall except our hall. In our hall, there is history, None of the tree(fallen or rotten) has been taken out for last 10 years. Due to this reason, there is complete mess at the backyard. Many trees have been eaten by insects, snakes and others insects has created their homes and fungus and other diseases start spreading from those rotten trees.

In this regarding, i have talked to Garden superintendent, state office and IMD department, they said, they will take action(removing all the fallen tree), only if hall's warden sign on agreement that they don't have to return empty handed, once they arrived here.

Note: This happened, last time, when they came to pick those trees and warden disallow them to do this.

I request you to give permission to do this. This is necessary for students safety and institute will also have some funds from those trees.
