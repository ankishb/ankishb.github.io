This is my interview experience for `ML` and `SDE` role at `Microsoft`. I am writting this post, to get out the thoughts, i am having from that moment.

`Microsoft` is my `dream` company. While preparing for interview, i always had `1` target, that is `MS`. It motivated me for my entire jouney of around `5` months(started from `july`). I prepared `c++`, `data structure and algorithms`, `database management system`, `machine learning`, `Data Science`, `deep learning`, `statistical learning`, my `master thesis` and a lot of their research in `Bing search Engine, Recommendation system, visual search and MS products`. My general objective for each day was to solve atleast `5` question on `interviewbit`, `hackerrank`, `geeksforgeeks` and `leetcode`. Here is the list of all coding program, i tried in all these months [link](https://github.com/ankishb/Algorithm-DS-Problems/blob/master/all_programs_list.md) I prepared my last minutes notes on `ML`, `DS`, `c++` as well. During this journey, there was a lot of challenges. But each such moments leaves an amazing experimence behind me.

> Lets directly jump into interview process of MS

1. First there was written exam for both profile for `1.50 hours` each. There was `160` student in `ML` and `208` student in `SDE` test. For `ML`, `12` were selected and `88` + `12`(through other resources such as `referal` and `codefun` contest) for `SWE`.
2. After that there was `group fly` round for `SDE` profiles, there `50` student made through it
3. Now, comes interview round, there was at `3` round and each one is `elimination` round. My first round is on `ML`, this is single person round. My interviewer was `10` minute late, due to flight delay. He started with introduction and checked my resume. He highlighted my `Statistical learning` interest, and asked me what is your favourite algorithm in `ML`, I told hime `Tree Based Model`. 




















Now comes the saddest part, and it is killing me each day. I was rejected at final/overall decision. The rejection is a part of this process, but not knowing, what could have gone wrong, is making me sick. There has been `15` after interview, but i still have same sort of feeling. There is always same set of questions, which are killing me softly each day. These are, what is their reason of my rejection, what is my weakest section, which skills i am lagging
If i know that i may work on them for future refernces. As `MS` is my `dream` company and I will apply again till i get in there. 




Now it seems that my career is completely ruined, i have applied in so many company for 6 month internship, but everyday i am getting rejection. This make me think that either i should give up on my thoughts/hope.

My thoughts are very limited to Microsoft and Amazon. I am applying in both company for 6 month now, but never had a chances of interview outside campus. I think, i should give up on these company and move on. Today i do have an offer from SAP lab for cloud development, but i am not sure, i ever be able to fulfil my dream of becoming data scientist. I do possess a lot of ML skills, but outside that all are limited and i don't know i ever could shine. 

I always wanted a great mentor, with which i can discuss my ideas, and who can give me challenging problem to work on, who can help by mentoring, advice, or my mistakes, but never get a chance to do that. I do have a mentor for my M.tech thesis, but we didn't have any discussion on how to do that. A problem(name of topic) is given, now you have to write a paper on it. Everyone thinks that i do have amazing opportunity as i am in IIT, now i have great offer in placement, but inside me, i am very disappointed on my life. Some time we hope for things, even there are challenges in the path, we appreciate(because there is a hope). Now it seems like everything has been shattered and there is no hope from anywhere. My mentor is not giving any direction. I want to publish paper on Ml in top conference, and a lot of time i have greate ideas, but it dies in a few days, after having no support or direction. I believe in collaboration, team work. But i could not find anyone, which wants to work without their selfness.

But i want is to have a greate mentor, which can guide, help, push my boundaries. i am a very talented guy, i catch things at fast pace, I worked on my data-science, machine-learning, deep-learning, data-base-management-system skill, all alone by following internet. I am competent, self made, passionate, want to leave impact on people life by ML. But i never get any help from my mentor, The worst one is that he didn't share referal for mirosoft research program, he didn't read a paper i submitted in a conference, he didn't help when i was having lot of trouble duing my thesis. i don't know, what experience i am building. People generally think, IIT peoples have opportunity, I do have greate resources like computer, internet, library, but it is not like what they think
